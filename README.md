# Question Tool

The question and answer tool is a real-time web application written in Meteor.js that allows anyone with a web browser and connection to the server to create a question/answer instance on a particular subject, propose a question, view other's questions, reply to questions and vote on questions on that particular subject.

For any server that is running the question tool software, any number of subject instances can be active at one time.  All users of an instance see any actions performed on the instance at the same time (voting, posting of questions or responses, etc) thanks to the magic of Meteor.js.

## Usage

The question tool was written to gather questions from an online audience and present them in a coherent and ordered way that communicates the communities interest in those questions by means of votes or responses.

The tool has various permission levels:

* Server Admin:	can rename or delete any instance, plus user privileges.
* Instance Admin: can unhide questions, add moderators, delete or rename instance, plus moderator privileges.
* Instance Moderator: can hide or merge	questions, plus	user privileges.
* Registered User: can create instances, can favorite instances.
* User: can post questions or replies as anonymous, pseudonymous, or signed.

By design, all instances are public - anyone with a web browser and connection to the server can view any instance, question or response, with the exception questions hidden by instance admins or moderators.

A user who is signed in can create an instance with a specific topic, after which web users can propose questions. Once the question is submitted, users can then vote on the question. Questions that are new, active or popular are pushed to the top. Users can also reply to questions.
