# Question Tool

TODO: Update the project description

The question and answer tool is a web application written in Meteor.js that allows anyone with a web browser and connection to the server to propose and vote on questions on a particular subject. A question tool author can create an instance with a specific topic, after which web users can propose questions. Once the question is submitted, users can then vote on the question. Questions that are more popular are pushed to the top. Users can also comment on the questions.

Admins of the instance have various special privileges, eg can mute or delete certain questions, suspend the instance, etc.
